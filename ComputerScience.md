### Unit for data volume

******************************
1. a **Kilobyte** is one thousand bytes (10^3 bytes).
2. a **Megabyte** is a million bytes (10^6 bytes).
3. a **Gigabyte** is a billion bytes (10^9 bytes).
4. a **Terabyte** is a trillion bytes (10^12 bytes).
5. a **Petabyte** is 1,000 Terabytes (10^15 bytes).
6. an **Exabyte** is 1,000 Petabytes (10^18 bytes).
7. a **Zettabyte** is 1,000 Exabytes (10^21 bytes).
8. a **Yottabyte** is 1,000 Zettabytes (10^24 bytes).

### Read, Write Speed
******************************
1. HDDs, found in desktop computers, are either designed to read and write faster or to store data. Standard HDD reads and writes at typical rates typical 80MB/s to 160MB/s.
 
$$ t = { 1048576 * 3600 \over 160 }  =  1.82 hours$$

3. SSDs are built for both short-term and long-term backups, they are more frequently used in applications that require speed.  SSD reads and writes data at a rate of between 200MB/s and 550MB/s.

$$ t = { 1048576 * 3600 \over 550 }  = 0.529 hours$$
