# Generative AI

Existing Algorithms like **CHATGPT** and **GOOGLE GEMINI** that can be used to generate images, texts, audio, video, and etc. Stable diffusion, Dalle-2, mid journey uses GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks), whereas CHATGPT uses large language model. The main difference amond all these are how much images used to training and what type of images used for training. Besides, the model weights. 

## Generative Adversarial Networks

* **Generative** means Create new content
* **Adversarial** means 2 models that work opposite to each other. 2 Network models (G, D) interconnected. G network generates the pixels and images, while the D network is a discrimantor network decides the authenticity of the images and pixels  
* **Network** means Neural Network

## Large Language Models
