# Networking

### Architecture
* **Client-server architecture**
1. Client: The client is the computer or device that requests a service from the server. Clients are often situated at workstations or on personal computers. 
2. Server: The server is the computer that provides the requested service to the client. Servers are typically more powerful machines located elsewhere on the network.
3. Network protocols: The client and server communicate over a network using standard communication protocols like TCP/IP.
