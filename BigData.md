# Big Data
Big Data is a Large data that are difficult to process with traditional tools. If one of the three criteria—Volume, Velocity, or Variety—becomes impossible to manage with traditional tools, data may be referred to as big data.


Data is basically divided into three categories: 
***********
1. Structured (column field: **known**, column field data type: **known**) Example: Excel files or SQL databases
2. Semi-structured (column field: **known**, column field data type: **unknown**) Example: CSV, JSON documents
3. Unstructured (column field: **unknown**, column field data type: **unknown**) that doesnt exist like relational database table Example: weather data, plain text files, server logs
***********
The process of transforming unstructured to structured is called ETL (Extract-Transform-Load). To achieve ETL quickly for a big data, one must go for large super computes, which has a distributed (own memory and own CPU) or shared (shared memory and own CPU) systems.
