# Big Data

Data is divided into three categories: 
***********
1. Structured (column field: **known**, column field data type: **known**) Example: Excel files or SQL databases
2. Semi-structured (column field: **known**, column field data type: **unknown**) Example: CSV, JSON documents
3. Unstructured (column field: **unknown**, column field data type: **unknown**) that doesnt exist like relational database table Example: weather data, plain text files, server logs
***********
The process of transforming unstructured to structured is called ETL (Extract-Transform-Load)
